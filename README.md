Abstract:The classical Poisson process assumes equidispersion (equal mean and variance) however this is not always the case when we analyze empirical distributions.  The weighted Poisson process accounts for this discrepancy by assigning a weight function to the Poisson distribution PMF.  This paper will derive the dispersion of two weighted Poisson models.  One with a falling factorial weight and another with an inverse rising factorial starting at n+1. The two models will be underdispersed and overdispersed respectively, a simulation study will then be conducted to plot the change in dispersion over time and to compare with the traditional Poisson Process.
